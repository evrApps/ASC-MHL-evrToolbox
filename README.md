# ASC-MHL evrToolbox
The ASC MHL, or Media Hash List, is an important metadata application that tracks the integrity of all media files along with a chain-of-custody and verification of data and provide a reference for digital motion picture production and can be used for data management, archiving and exchange purposes.

The ASC MHL evrToolbox is a free tool included in the evrApp, which allows users to check the integrity of media files. The tool computes hashes and compares them to previous MHLs files, as well as checks the file system structure for any discrepancies. It can be used in conjunction with evrExpanse to ensure that any ASC MHLs produced in accordance with the standard specification are accurate and free from errors.
